today i have changed my host name from hyenvy-hyperland -> hpenvy-hyprland
i made a mistake by adding an additional e in hyprland while setting up my os
i was suggested to change my hostname in hosts
```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
after changing my name, i have rebooted my device and i didn't notice any change in my hostname
so i surfed for alternate  way and came up with this one
```
 sudo hostnamectl set-hostname hpenvy-hyprland
```
after reboot , i noticed the change in my hostname


then , i encounterd few errors
starting with chrome

```

3791:3791:0322/163756.740493:ERROR:process_singleton_(3234)] The profile appears to be in use by another Chrome process (3234) on another computer (hyenvy-hyperland). Chrome has locked the profile so that it doesn't get corrupted. If you are sure no other processes are using this profile, you can unlock the profile and relaunch Chrome.

```
when i surfed the internet again i noticed a similar issue in
```
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=294107
```

i then noticed i dont have a chromium directory instread i had

lrwxrwxrwx    - rishabh 21 Jan 16:52 î—¿ google-chrome -> /run/user/1000/psd/rishabh-google-chrome

then after running
```
ls -l /run/user/1000/psd/rishabh-google-chrome
```
i was able to detect the SingletonLock which caused the error then removed it by
```
 sudo rm /run/user/1000/psd/rishabh-google-chrome/SingletonLockSingletonLock

```
i additionally removed SingletonCookie , SingletonSocket along with it which are related to SingletonLock

finally i was able to open chrome


today i was facing an issue in updating my linux
```
error: GPGME error: No data
error: GPGME error: No data
error: GPGME error: No data
```

faced error like this
then made a backup of mirror list
```
sudo mv /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak
```
 regenerated pacman key
 ```
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
sudo rm -R /var/lib/pacman/sync
```

run pacman key to re-generate trust roots
```
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate
```
update pacman as usual

the above was the standard instuction given in the arch community which i have followed then there comes the new one

then was solved by
```
sudo pacman-key --recv-key 3056513887B78AEB --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB
```
taken form
```
https://aur.chaotic.cx/docs
```

```
sudo pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst'
sudo pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-mirrorlist.pkg.tar.zst'
```
the above 2 lines are will handle the installation of files form chaotic repos

then a normal yay or sudo pacman -Syu was enough




Installing a package through aur

i was stuck after executing yay kodelife

not sure how to proceed after this

then found a way from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository

it had the simple ways

git clone {repo-link}

cd {repo-name}

makepkg

pacman -U {file with .zst}

gets it installed


Got this error while updating my system

NOTE  :  a clear of cache of the pacman didn't solve it 

 REASON :1 Outdated or broken `archlinux-keyring` or `garuda-keyring.

		 2. Corrupted local keyring or partial sync.


```
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring garuda-keyring
```

error faced after the above command

Look for any of the following:

- `garuda-common-settings`
    
- `garuda-system-maintenance`
    

If found:

```
sudo pacman -S chaotic-keyring
